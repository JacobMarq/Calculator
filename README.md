        How Percent key functions: 
        
            if entering variable 'a' 
                percent key result will display 0;
                    (result = 0)
        
            while using multiply or divide
            if entering variable 'b' and the current number is between 0 and 100
                percent key result will display the current number percent of variable 'a'; 
                    (result = x %of a)
            else 
                percent key result will display the current number as a percent; 
                    (result = x%)

            while using addition
            percent key result will display variable 'a' plus the current number percent of variable 'a'; 
                (result = a + (x %of a))

            while using subtraction
            percent key result will display variable 'a' minus the current number percent of variable 'a'; 
                (result = a + (x %of a))
